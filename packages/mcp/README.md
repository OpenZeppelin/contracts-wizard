# OpenZeppelin Contracts MCP Server

[![NPM Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@openzeppelin/contracts-mcp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openzeppelin/contracts-mcp)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows AI agents to generate smart contracts using OpenZeppelin Contracts libraries.

This server runs locally and requires Node.js to be installed. For a hosted version, see [OpenZeppelin MCP Servers](https://mcp.openzeppelin.com/).

> [!WARNING]
> AI agents determine when and how to use the MCP server and therefore may produce inaccurate results. You should always review any information produced by the AI agent to ensure that any results are accurate and suit your purposes.

## Features

Provides tools to generate smart contract source code for the following languages and contract kinds. Resulting contracts use OpenZeppelin Contracts libraries for each language. Tools are named in the format `<language>-<contract>`.

| Language | Contracts |
| --- | --- |
| solidity | erc20, erc721, erc1155, stablecoin, rwa, account, governor, custom |
| cairo | erc20, erc721, erc1155, account, multisig, governor, vesting, custom |
| stellar | fungible, stablecoin, non-fungible |
| stylus | erc20, erc721, erc1155 |

For manual installation:
1. Follow VS Code documentation to [Add an MCP server to your workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server-to-your-workspace) using the following configuration:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "OpenZeppelinContracts": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@openzeppelin/contracts-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
2. Start the MCP server according to [Manage MCP servers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_manage-mcp-servers).

## Usage

When interacting with an AI agent, for example in your IDE's Write or Agent mode, ask it to write or modify smart contracts for your use case. When the AI agent determines it is appropriate to do so, it will use the MCP server to generate the contracts or determine best practices for your use case.
